We all worked on multiple calls together to get the GUI to work how we wanted it. We all designed the look of the GUI, and worked together to make sure that the Jar file works. 
We all came together and created the User guide and took all of the screenshots. Over all the work was divided equally and all gave their all to make sure that the program worked.
